--SECTION 2 ----
-NAVIGATION TABLEAU
dimensions are independent variables VS measures are dependent variables
what we create in tableau is considered a worksheet
dashboard = collection of worksheets
story = collection of dashbaords
worksheet mainly created by deciding what goes into columns and rows

-CREATING CALCULATED FIELDS
-right click under measures-create calculated field 
-calculated fields will have a little equal sign to the right of it within the measure names section

-ADDING COLORS
-data science is a form of art so color is important lol
-you can drag dimensions into the column box to give them individual colors

-ADDING LABELS AND FORMATING
-format labels to make it quick and easy for people to read the charge



---SECTION 3---
-Working with Extracts-
when using tableau public it is always an extract of the data already vs live

--Working with TIme Series
-dimensions are in blue and measures are in green
-understand what we want from data with time series, do we want it as a dimension or measure so tableau can properly display the data

--Understanding Aggregation, granularity and level of detail--
-level of granularity refers to how much visibility you want aka how many points shown/measured

--Creating an Area chart and learning about highlighting
-go to your legend, right click on which item you want highlighted and click highlight selected only(something like that)

--Adding a Filter and Quick Filter--
-just drag what you want into the filter box to use the filter
-under filter right click and choose show quick filter to have quick filter box(acts like highlighting where you can click on each different filter to quickly see the differences between the data)
    -if you have multiple filters you would have to do this each time so each filter can have its own quick filter box

--Section 3 Quiz --
What you knowThese are questions you got right on the first try.
Which of these is a valid reason to use a Data Extract over a Live Connection to the Dataset in Tableau?
What is the difference between the Blue Month() and the Green Month() in Tableau?
Which of these explains the conceptual difference between a line chart and an area chart?
What you should review
How does Tableau know at which level to aggregate values?
Lecture 21 Understanding Aggregation, Granularity, and Level of Detail

Which of these is NOT a type of Quick Filter available in Tableau?
Lecture 23 Adding a Filter and Quick Filter

---SECTION 4 ---
--Joining Data in tableau --
In tableau each row of data will have a symbol next to it to show what type of data tableau recognizes it as 
    -ex: abc is text a calendar is date and a globe is map
in the page after you open up an excel file drag your first sheet over and then double clicking it
after double clciking it you can then drag over another sheet to it to create a join with it rather than a relationship

--Creating a map, working with hierarchies--
- To create a hierarchy just drag what you deem is a child to the parent to create a hierarchy sectiopn and from there conitnue adding to it
-a map can be made using data ctagorized with the globe symbol

--Creating a scatter plot, Applying filters to multiple worksheets
-To apply the same filter to every worksheet right click on the filter in a worksheet that is currently using it, go to apply to worksheets and then all using this data source

-Lets create our first dashboard--
click the square icon in the are where the sheets are to create a new dashboard 
very useful to look at multiple correlating sheets and see the changes between all of them in real time

--Adding an Interaction Action - Filter --
- go to dashboard(at the top), click action and go from there
-when selecting, you can actually move many by holding control while clicking or by using the select feature(it's the triangle play button logo)

--Adding an Interaction Action - Highlighting --
--highlighting is different from filtering with interaction action in dashboard as filtering actually FILTERS the data so you can reconstruct  where as with highlighting there is no filtering happening. With highlighting you are asking to plot everything while still showing the data that correlates to the highlight


----SECTION 5 ----
--Understanding How Left Right Inner and Outer Join Works--
-good review -

--Joins with Duplicate Values--
-What happens when the column we use has duplicate values
    -the single value matchign to duplicates will get duplicate to line up the data corrrectly

--Joining on Multiple Fields --
-joining on a single field can lead to incorrect results sometime so adding an additional field can help avoid that error
    -ex: two stores being joined on order# can make it look like you sold two items in both locations because there's only one field to join but if you add in the store field as well there will be a distinction with items sold

--The showdown: Joining Data vs Blending Data in Tableau --
- When lvl of granularity is different between two tables a blend is required instead of a join
-ALso when you are not able to do a join because the data sources are different

--Data Blending in tableau --
-Data blending often underestimated
-When tableau is prepare to blend the data between two data sets you'll see an orane line on the left and an orange link symbol next to one of the dimensions
-Data blending is like a 'smart' join
-To add additional joins to the blend go to data(at the tip ribbon) edit blend relationship

--Dual Axis Chart--
-The order of how you blend the data matters when going the custom route
-When you create a dual axis go to the axis right click AND CLICK SYNCHRONIZE AXIS VERY IMORTANT

--Creating calculated fields in a blend(advance topic) --
-This section is learning to create a calculated field with items  from both sets of data 
-Be aware of when trying to create a calculated field between a field that is aggregrated and one non aggregated. Best way to solve this issue is to add the sum of value to the non aggregated to make it aggregated



---SECTION 6----
--Mapping: How to set geographical roles--
-To change a dimension into a geographical role(get that globe icon so tableau can instinctively create a map for us) right click on the dimension, go to geographical role and then choose according

--Creating Tableau Calculationos for Gender--
-Go to the field you wish to do the calculation(ex changing the numbers to percentage of total), right click to open the drop down and go to edit table calculations. If you see a triangle next to it afterwards it indiciates that the table calculation has been implemented for that field
